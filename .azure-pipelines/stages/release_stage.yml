#As 2/21/2025, 1ES doesn't like non-stage templates, so we need to wrap all non-stage templates with a stage template

stages:
- stage: Stage
  jobs:
  - job: Job
    steps:
    - template: _release-template-stage.yml
      parameters:
        is1ES: true
    # Test the wheels. This needs to happen after PublishBuildArtifacts
    # to avoid interference with the artifacts
    - script: python -m pip install dist/*.whl --no-deps
      displayName: 'Install wheel'
